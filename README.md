CODEPPIR: CO-utile and DEcentralized Privacy Protection in Information Retrieval

Web search is probably the most popular service on the web. Most of the providers of these services, called web-search engines (WSEs), rely upon the construction of user profiles, which they build from past queries and employ to deliver personalized information retrieval. This personalization allows users to deal with the abundance of information, but inevitably at the expense of intrusive privacy. In this application, we implement self-enforced protocols whereby users will rationally exchange part of their queries (before being submitted to a search engine), to hide their respective interest profiles vs the WSE and vs other users. Natural language processing and a semantical analysis of the queries will be conducted to determine the possible private profile disclosure. To do this, we take advantatge from tinyNLP models to make the solution efficiently executable on domestics environments. The application is implemented as a web-browser plug-in and will enable users to protect their interest profile from the Google search engine. The ultimate aim of this application is to show how users can take advantage of the concept of collaborative privacy to regulate the disclosure of their private profiles using tinyNLP models, while, at the same time, preserving the functionality of the online service (i.e. getting their queries answered).

The CODEPPIR application is developed by researches of the [CRISES](https://crises-deim.urv.cat/web/) group at the [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](http://www.urv.cat/en/) in Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain).
